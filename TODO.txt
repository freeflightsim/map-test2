* Missing or badly formed three.js json 3D models

New models, generated by assimp, 438 in the 'ac' folder...
Some missing, or but NOT cleaned of light cones, shadows, wheels, etc...

TODO: 20131106: Concorde_b - missing, but do have a 'concorde' - how to 'expand this fuzzy search best???

TODO: 20131106: B1900D - missing, but do have a b1900d, so in get_model_source(), add a case insensitive search,
      but the b1900d model needs lights and wheels removed

DONE: U-2S - missing - found : http://wiki.flightgear.org/Lockheed_U-2S - downloaded,
      mod F:\FG\fgd-plus\Aircraft\U-2S\Models\3D - U-2S.js - gen using ac2gl_browser2/assimp
