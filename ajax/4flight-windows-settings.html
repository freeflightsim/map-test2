	<p>More map types will arrive - including 3D views.
		Each window will have a symbol of the plane with the current heading.
		Also you will be able to adjust the zoom scale. Eventually each window will have its own settings.
	</p>

	<p>You may quite quickly run through your allowed views of Google Maps. If so, switch to Open Streets for an hour or so...</p>
